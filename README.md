# Superstore Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data from a fictional superstore to uncover revenue drivers, seasonal trends, and underperforming regions. The goal is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills using Python, Excel, and Tableau to answer real business questions.

## Dataset
- Source: Public Superstore Sales dataset
- Records: ~10,000+ orders
- Key fields: Order Date, Product Category, Sub-Category, Sales, Profit, Region

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Excel (pivot tables, lookup functions)
- Tableau Public (interactive dashboards)

## Business Questions
- Which product categories and sub-categories generate the most revenue?
- How does seasonality affect sales performance?
- Which regions are underperforming in terms of profit?
- Are there high-revenue but low-profit product segments?

## Key Insights
- A small number of product categories drive a majority of total revenue.
- Sales exhibit clear seasonal spikes during specific months.
- Certain regions consistently underperform despite strong order volume.
- Some high-volume products have low or negative profit margins.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing and inventory investment on high-margin categories.
- Review pricing or cost structure for consistently unprofitable products.
- Target underperforming regions with localized promotions or logistics improvements.

## Deliverables
- Python notebook for data cleaning and analysis
- Excel workbook with pivot-table analysis
- Tableau dashboard for executive-level insights
