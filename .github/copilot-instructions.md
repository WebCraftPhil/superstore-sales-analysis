# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository is a portfolio-style data analysis project intended for entry-level data analyst roles.

## General Guidelines
- Prioritize clarity, readability, and correctness over clever or overly compact code
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect business meaning (e.g., total_sales, profit_margin)
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or advanced patterns
- Assume the audience includes non-engineers and hiring managers

## Python Standards
- Use pandas for data manipulation
- Write code in a step-by-step, notebook-friendly style
- Add comments explaining *why* an operation is performed, not just what it does
- Avoid chained operations that reduce readability
- Prefer explicit intermediate variables for clarity

## Data Analysis Focus
- Frame analysis around business questions, not just transformations
- Include brief markdown explanations between code sections
- Generate simple, interpretable visualizations (bar charts, line charts, grouped summaries)
- Avoid overly complex statistical modeling unless explicitly requested

## Visualization Guidelines
- Charts should have clear titles, axis labels, and legends
- Avoid excessive styling or unnecessary colors
- Optimize for insight and interpretability, not aesthetics alone

## Excel & Tableau Context
- Assume outputs may be consumed by non-technical stakeholders
- Structure data exports to be pivot-table friendly
- Favor tidy, well-labeled data tables

## What to Avoid
- Do not introduce advanced ML models, neural networks, or deep learning
- Do not over-engineer solutions
- Do not assume production deployment requirements
- Do not refactor purely for stylistic reasons

## Goal
The goal is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills, clear communication, and the ability to answer real business questions using Python, Excel, and Tableau.
